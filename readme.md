<a id="project-philosophy">
> Closer web app is a platform aiming to promote physical meetings for communities sharing the same interest. Closer is here to help you communicate with your fellow community members and establish a common bond.
> 
> It is pretty straight forward. You go in you look up the category you want, access the event you like and book your spot just like that.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to go somewhere that plays only R&B music, I want to discover such places so that avoid confusion on outing destination.
- As a user, I want to see events based on their location to take into account the trip's gas consumption.
- As a user, I want to see who is making events the most and their popularity.

Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Closer app uses:
- This project uses the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/). Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
- As database, MySQL was used.
- Closer uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library for the frontend. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs, is component-based and is reusable.
- For the use of the map [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) was implemented. Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library.
- The project uses [react-dropzone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropzone) in order to add the drag and drop functionality.
- This project also uses [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) in order to animate components and add fun transitions between pages.
