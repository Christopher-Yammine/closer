> Closer web app is a platform aiming to promote physical meetings for communities sharing the same interest. Closer is here to help you communicate with your fellow community members and establish a common bond.

> It is pretty straight forward. You go in you look up the category you want, access the event you like and book your spot just like that.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to go somewhere that plays only R&B music, I want to discover such places so that avoid confusion on outing destination.
- As a user, I want to see events based on their location to take into account the trip's gas consumption.
- As a user, I want to see who is making events the most and their popularity.
